    <h1><i>Setting the Table</i></h1>
    <p>Professional growth is not typically encouraged and nurtured in a coffee shop, but Storyville was an exception. Kris encouraged us to read specific books, write reviews, and earn a bonus. The following is an excerpt from my review on Danny Meyer's bestselling book on bringing hospitality into business, <i>Setting the Table.</i></p>
    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p>An extension of trusting oneself, personal worth and ideology, is trusting the people around you. Everyone at
    Madison was hired by the same people that hired me – if I’m not a bad decision, they probably weren’t either.<br>
    The 51% Solution, as Meyer calls it, is that it’s better to hire someone with 51% heart and 49% skill. In other
    words, as Lucas and others have also discussed, it’s much better and easier to hire the right culture fit rather
    than someone with loads of experience. Day-to-day technical skills are much easier to teach than emotional skills
    (though, as a budding cognitive psychologist and someone who has overcome massive deficits in his own life, it is
    possible to teach emotional skills to adults, though it requires openness on the pupil’s part).<br>
    The perspective I shared in the opening paragraph of this section is something worth deep consideration by all
    workers. You’re surrounded by people who are deemed worthy to be there. The more we focus on teamwork, the better
    chance of success for all involved.<br>
    This also extends to guest experience as well. If I’m a customer at a coffee shop, the last thing I should deserve
    to stomach is drama from behind bar. If there’s blaming, miscommunication (or a simple lack of it), sabotage, name
    calling, angst, etc., I’d personally consider walking out and never going back. Any kind of smiles or kindness
    directed toward me will be completely discredited – as Meyer points out, “service without soul, no matter how
    elegant, is quickly forgotten by the guest.” <br>
    Unfortunately, as I’m sure we all have, I have been part of situations like that more than once with a coworker.
    Skilled as the coworker may have been, it’s a universally horrible experience for all involved, and as unjustified
    and unacceptable as it is preventable. <br>
    Emotional intelligence is about realizing what you bring into the situation and how that affects everyone around
    you. It can be approached as simply as asking yourself whether you want to be a poison to someone’s experience or a
    Meyer likes to have a foundation of trust, respect and enjoyment. With a perspective like that, we can build an
    affinity with each other, much like Meyer explained about the guests he looked for when he opened his Indian
    restaurant. When you find guests that believe in the product, design, staff, etc., you’ve found fans, or people who
    are willing to grow with you despite chaos that may happen initially or along the way. Those types of people are
    willing to forgive flaws and setbacks because they understand the quality of the place and the product.<br>
    It’s insufficient to discuss emotional intelligence without bringing up forgiveness. If our eyes are on the worth
    of a coworker or guest, we’ll be more likely to be there for them and forgive their ignorance or setbacks or
    general flaws or awkwardness. It’s essential for the stability of staff. If we aren’t willing to be patient and
    forgiving with our coworkers, it’s a recipe for disaster all the way around. There is an entire chapter dedicated
    to the idea beautifully entitled “The Road to Success is Paved with Mistakes Well Handled.” <br>
    Just like designing a restaurant from scratch, we need to understand what we have to work with and what kind of
    experience that’s creating for ourselves and others. There’s no room for complacency or unkindness toward guests or
    coworkers. That will result in a negative experience.<br>
    Meyer also talks about the 5 emotional skills he believes are most important in the hospitality industry. Even the
    simple descriptors on in the list on page 143 are enough to savor and digest.<br>
    If we only focused on Optimistic warmth, especially the genuine part, we’d be doing well for ourselves. The big 3
    that stand out to me, however, are his take on intelligence, empathy and self-awareness and integrity.<br>
    “Hospitality is a team sport.” The reason I love the Seahawks as much as I do is because of how undeniably keen
    they are to support each other. A great example came from 2016’s regular season game against the Falcons when
    Sherman was livid on the sidelines. Other teams would blame or internalize and collapse, but instead, the Seattle
    defense helped bring him back up by showing their support. They realize they’re on the same team, that his focus is
    part of their success.,br>
    Hospitality works in a very similar way when it comes to coworkers. What we do and say to and about our coworkers
    in regard to mistakes or things we might not understand will determine success or failure. We can choose gossip
    (talking about people, almost always behind they’re back) or seeking to understand the person (talking to the
    person). We can choose relentless and unrealistic expectations or be willing to forgive and laugh-off common
    mistakes, seeking comradery and common ground. Kindness is always a choice, so to opt-out of it really shouldn’t be
    tolerated.<br>
    In his description of intelligence, he emphasizes an “insatiable curiosity to learn for the sake of learning.” This
    is how gossip ends and how we can also show our coworkers we legitimately care about them. The most unique features
    we can dig out of them, the more connectivity we’ll have with them, the less alien they’ll feel, the more valued
    and valuable they’ll feel.<br>
    We have an innate need to belong and feel valued. No one wants to feel like a burden or liability. Empathy,
    especially as Meyer describes (“an awareness of, care for, and connection to how others feel and how your actions
    make others feel” – emphasis added), enables us to be accountable for how we make others feel.<br>
    That’s where self-awareness and integrity come in. They are reciprocal features of the same thing, and they allow
    us to hold ourselves accountable to do the right thing. If we lack empathy, we are poking holes in our own
    integrity.<br>
    I have a unique challenge in the self-awareness category, in that I tend to over focus on what I might be
    contributing to the point that it becomes self-consciousness instead of cognizant awareness that would allow me to
    make decisions. To go along with the old Taoist adage, “too much is the same as not enough.” Empathy is great,
    doing the right thing is great, but over focus or neglect on either is going to do harm.<br>
    Reciprocity is what emotional intelligence really boils down to. What experience am I having? Is it what I want to
    experience? If so, awesome, and how can I influence others to have a similar experience? If not, what can I do to
    change it so I can positively influence others?<br>
    The delicate balance is just between over-care or over-concern and appropriate awareness. It’s necessary to note
    how your thoughts, moods and behaviors affect and influence others, but it becomes a trap when we start being
    over-concerned or neglectful of it.
