    <h1><i>To Ignite But Not Burn</i></h1>
    <p>2013 saw one of my main ambitions come to fruition as I self-published my first book. The content is largely personal, providing an in depth experience in creating a more positive life, and sets the tone for a sequential memoir, allowing me to grow and share along the way.<br>
    This excerpt is from the opening section and gives background on the importance of language.</p>
    <h2>Words Aren't "Just Words"</h2>
<p> What is to be expected in this? A lot of mental trial and error. My insecurities, my weaknesses, are
    completely exposed, but so are the bright spots. I’m totally naked and honest about it all.<br>
    The process was gross at first. Very unkempt, every second a slapdash attempt at getting back on my feet and to
    make sense of the world in and around me.<BR>
    I learned fairly quickly that language is huge. There’s a massive difference between how I talked to myself, about
    myself, in the first entry as opposed to those in proceeding entries.<BR>
    The first few entries allow a glimpse into the mindset that I left behind. The one that I carried when I entered
    the tunnel but dropped and allowed to evanesce somewhere in the midst of my journey.<BR>
    I should mention now, the definition of “through.” Because we all hear that “everyone goes through things,” and I
    boldly dispute that. “Through” is a preposition that “indicate[s] movement into at one side or point and out at
    another and especially the opposite side of.”<BR>
    I don’t bring up this refutation as a means of comparison to say I’m superior than those who struggle, that’s
    literally opposite of my objective, but rather as an imperative clarification in language - in other words, to
    correct a lie that a lot of people use on a regular basis. A lot of people, most people I’ve met, go in one side
    and get stuck, falling victim to circumstance, genetics, external dominance, whatever. Some traumas affect people
    for a lifetime.<BR>
    In order to go through something, one must learn how to let go, trust that such opposition can be overcome, or at
    least accepted to the point that said ailment does not interfere with any aspect of daily life, to see objectively,
    accept unconditionally, and allow themselves to move beyond whatever trial is testing them. It’s not an easy thing
    at all, and even nearly two years later, after steady practice, I still haven’t mastered some of the most ingrained
    struggles. Namely, affection. But progress is a process, and I know full well that I’ll get there.<BR>
    As you’ll be able to see, I’ve already come a very, very long way. And, the cliche, but because I did it, I know
    it’s possible. I encourage you to find the same courage to overcome your past. It is possible, and depending on the
    amount of patient dedication you’re willing to make toward your own fulfillment, the more probable your success
    becomes.<BR>

    I began this journey with a new, bold-faced definition for “my own worst enemy” freshly slashed across my side and
    not allowed to scab and heal over. It didn’t take long for me to realize that I could not continue that trend, and
    that if I were to be deserving of love, I’d have to be the first to show it to myself. That began the long, arduous
    process of overturning my weapons of self-destruction into tools for self-creation: the essence of true Alchemy.
    It’s been known to me for years that the worst enemy of something or someone can turn out to be the best friend
    (and vice versa). With the amount of passion and dedication I had toward my own self-loathing, I knew that if I
    were to transmute that into self-love, I’d be bullet proof.<BR>

    I stopped degrading myself, weighing myself unnecessarily and unfairly against others and imagined expectations.
    Instead of treating myself like the scum of the earth, I decided to treat myself like I would treat a friend or
    loved one. At no point in my life, if I saw a friend struggle like I did, would I have the balls to berate them
    like I did myself - half the words I used on myself back then would never fly from my mouth toward someone else’s
    ear, whether considered friend or otherwise.<BR>
    Without any doubt, that was the single most important decision I’ve ever made in my life.<BR>

    The heart doesn’t care where love comes from, location is a non-factor to it. It just needs love in order to
    survive. The best part is, love is unlimited. It doesn’t have to come from anyone in particular, however, you’re
    the only one that can help yourself feel it 24/7. No one else can, or should - it’s your responsibility. So if you
    feel a lack of love, I can easily and deeply relate, but I can also use the fatherly tough love to say, it’s your
    responsibility to turn that around. No one else’s.<BR>
    For me, it was a simple shift in the language I used on myself, and the onslaught of expressing gratitude toward
    everyone in my life - even if the only person at the time was I.<BR>
    One of the biggest things I learned out of this was the more love I showed myself, the easier it was to see things
    done by other people toward me as expressions of love. Our own capacity for self-love is the cup that inevitably
    holds the love with which others can fill it. We can only translate love so far as our own vocabulary for it can
    pick up. So if we’re not used to seeing certain things as expressions of love, they won’t be received as such.
    Further, if we expect a certain kind of love, we put on blinders to any other form of expression.
